In React Native, when working with FlatList or SectionList, a common yet subtle issue arises when dealing with dynamic data updates.  If you are updating the data using this.setState or the useState hook without proper key handling, you may encounter unexpected behavior.  If the keys are not unique and consistent across data updates, React Native's diffing algorithm may fail to identify changes efficiently and may not re-render the list correctly, or re-render items in the incorrect order. This can lead to missing items, duplicate items or items that aren't updated, even if the data itself changes in the state. This also leads to performance issues.
